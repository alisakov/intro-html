      You are not alone. Panic attacks are more common than you think - especially as a result
      of the effects of the Covid-19. Take a minute to read what helped me to get through hard
      times and don't forget to breath.

          Breathing is the first step to calm your body. when your body is calm, 
          your mind calms itself automatically after a while because it no more feels
          in danger (fight or fight affect).

          It's always best that when you're having an anxiety attack to find a person around
          you feel close enough to, to spill your feelings to. Even if they wouldn't be able
          to help, the act of talking your feelings out will help.

          but in case you are around strangers and you can't call your loved ones, there is 
          this adorable and soothing app - a penguin AI therapist. it includes psychology insights 
          and exercises. Very useful in moments of need and with getting out of your head.

          I recommend putting together a playlist of songs that calm you down. It can be songs
          that are quiet and soothing or ones that cheer you up. When you feel you're getting anxious,
          and talking to people dindn't help or you just don't feel like it, find a quiet place away
          from people, put on your headphones and listen to that playlist you made earlier.
          You can use mine as an example: 
          <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0cs6VYf9pkqpRG3D58pO7M?si=RiNiIsakQeGN-_tfRfNM7Q"
